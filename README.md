This is a visual portfolio of the projects I have done with a bit more in-depth explanations about most of them. Some of them have been school projects and some of them are projects I have completed on my own time. Links to each project on GitHub, my GitHub profile, my LinkedIn, and contact information can all be found on my portfolio.
