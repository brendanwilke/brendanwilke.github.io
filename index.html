            <p>
              I'm an aspiring software engineer looking for an internship for
              the summer of 2021. Here you will find a listing of the projects I
              have worked in on Java, JavaScript, and Python throughout the past
              few years. There is a mix of OOP, data structures, and algorithms
              that I have used to make most of these projects.

                This is one of my biggest accomplishments as a programmer:
                HeliGame. It is a 4 player contious sidescrolling game made in
                Java through Java Graphics. Each player gets their own button to
                press to fly there "Heli". The squares move to the right at a
                constant velocity so the players only have to worry about
                fighting gravity to avoid crashing into the objects inside the
                cave. Every line of this project was coded with a friend through
                paired programming. We made sure that we understood exactly what
                was going on together and did not move on until we had that
                understanding. This is by far the longest project I have
                completed and it totals over 1000 lines of code. Fun fact:
                Single button controllers were mapped to to each of the player's
                buttons and the game display was put into an arcade machine for
                people to play during school.

            <p>
              The Bankist application is a pseudo-banking system where you can
              login to one of the 4 accounts stored in the system, deposit money
              to other accounts, request a loan within reason (i.e. you must
              have at least 10% of the value you are asking for), and delete
              accounts entirely. This logic behind this application involved a
              lot of array manipulation

            <p>
              A* Pathfinding is an algorithm that finds a shortest path from a
              start node to an end node. The algorithm must take into account
              the black barriers put up between the start and node when finding
              the shortest path. A visualization of the final path found can be
              seen in purple above.

              This application can take any .txt file located within the Java
              Project folder and find how many times each word was used in that
              .txt file. There is also a function to sort them from most used to
              least used. This project uses a combination of HashMaps to assign
              key/value pairs where the word is the key and the value is the
              number of times the word has been used, and LinkedLists to contain
              the elements in the sorting method. This has real-world use like
              seeing if you are using a word too many times in an essay.

              one of the dealer's cards at a time. The player will be prompted
              to hit or stand until they decide to stand. The person closest to
              reaching a total value of 21 between all their cards is the

              Pig Game is a 2 player game where the objective is to score 100 by
              rolling the dice and then holding to add it to your score. A
              player can roll as many times as they desire, but when a 1 is
              rolled, it switches to the next player's turn and that built up
              score cannot be added. Javascript is used for DOM Maniuplation and
              adding/removing CSS classes to certain elements.

              of the screen or the game is over automatically when your health
              bar depletes entirely. More OOP is displayed here.

              A random number 1-20 is generated when this game is opened and the

              you know if you are too high or low will appear on the page. When
              you select the right number, the screen will turn green and you
              will get a message saying that your guess is correct. This is the
              first JavaScript project I did, and it introduced me to DOM
              Manipulation and modifying CSS style through JavaScript.
